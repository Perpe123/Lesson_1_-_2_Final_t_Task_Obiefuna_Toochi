                <p>
                    This is the week where the Campeonas, just like other
                    university leavers organize and engage in socio-cultural
                    activities.

                <p>
                    Here, we had dinner party, picnic, movie night, jeans
                    carnival and so many other fun-filled activities just create
                    and have beautiful memories together after 5 years of
                    stressful academic workload.

                    The challenges we encountered during this course of study
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was never easy from the very first beginning. It was
                    after some of us were stepped down and had to repeat their
                    100 level because they didn't pass all the courses offered
                    in the level that we got a clearer understanding of what we
                    signed up for. We had to try the much we could to manage the
                    heavy academic work load; the individual courses with their
                    multiple lecturers each with their own hand outs and study
                    materials, the practical classes some of which we had to
                    work with animals such as rats and toads. Funnily enough,
                    sometimes we had to stay in school till late hours because
                    we had to wait for our little friends (rats) to wake up so
                    we could record how long they were unconscious after
                    inducing anaesthesia or for any other reasons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The times when most of us get promoted to the next level
                    while some were made to repeat and a few others told to
                    change to another department. The demotion and separation
                    didn't go down well with us emotionally and financially, but
                    then they all happened for the right reasons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During our final year days it was a different ball game, we
                    all had to multi-task as we did our project, went for
                    clerkship and still attended lectures. We passed through
                    both physical and mental stress just to bag this degree and
                    thank God today we are <strong>CAMPEONAS!</strong>

                <h3 id="advice">Our advice to the students out there</h3>
                <p>Don't ever give up on your dreams!</p>
                <p>
                    Learning is never done without errors and corrections, that
                    is the only way to learn and to grow.
                </p>
                <p>Remember, the expert in anything was once a beginner.</p>
